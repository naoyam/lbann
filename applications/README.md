## Applications:

The application directory contains the user-facing code for projects
to use LBANN.  Each project directory should contain the python code
to instantiate the model, run both training and inference, an
experiments directory, as well as utility / helper code to pre- or
post-process data.

These are some of applications that leverage LBANN:
- [Atom](ATOM/README.md): Accelerating Therapeutics for Opportunities
  in Medicine (ATOM) - Networks for predicting molecular compounds
  that are optimized for multiple objectives
